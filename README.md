Google Code Jam
===============

Introduction
------------
Google Code Jam is an international programming competition hosted and administered by Google. The competition began in 2003 as a means to identify top engineering talent for potential employment at Google. The competition consists of a set of algorithmic problems which must be solved in a fixed amount of time. Competitors may use any programming language and development environment to obtain their solutions.


Why am I doing this?
--------------------
The problems are very interesting and very challenging. I have not yet directly participated in the Jam but I am planning to do so soon. As a part of my preparation I will solve the previous years problems. It will not only hone my algorithmic skills but will also sharpen my already sharp programming chops. :)
